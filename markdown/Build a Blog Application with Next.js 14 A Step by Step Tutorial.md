Project Overview & Goals {#project-overview}

Next.js 14 solidifies its position as a premier framework for building production-ready React applications. With its powerful App Router, server-side rendering by default, and enhanced developer experience, it's an ideal choice for creating high-performance blogs.

In this hands-on tutorial, we will build a fully functional, dynamic blog application from scratch. By the end, you will have a deep understanding of key Next.js 14 concepts and a deployable project for your portfolio.

What We'll Build:

· A blog homepage listing all posts.
· Dynamic, SEO-friendly pages for each individual blog post.
· A layout with clean, responsive styling.
· Optimized metadata for search engines.
· A live, deployed application.

Tech Stack:

· Framework: Next.js 14 (with App Router)
· Styling: CSS Modules
· Data Source: JSONPlaceholder API (Mock Data)
· Deployment: Vercel

Prerequisites & Environment Setup {#environment-setup}

Before we start, ensure your development environment is ready.

1. Node.js: You must have Node.js version 18.17 or later installed. You can check your version by running node -v in your terminal.
2. Code Editor: Use a modern code editor like VS Code.
3. Terminal & Git: Basic familiarity with the terminal and Git is required.

Project Structure & Initial Setup {#project-structure}

Let's initialize our project and understand the foundation.

1. Create a New Next.js App: Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Next.js project. You'll be prompted to configure a few options; select them as shown below.
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog
   ```
   When prompted:
   · Would you like to use TypeScript? No (for this tutorial, but highly recommended for real projects)
   · Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
   · Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No (we'll use CSS Modules)
   · Would you like to use src/ directory? No
   · Would you like to use App Router? Yes (this is crucial!)
   · Would you like to customize the default import alias? No
2. Navigate and Start: Change into the project directory and start the development server.
   ```bash
   cd nextjs-blog
   npm run dev
   ```
3. View Your App: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see the default Next.js starter page.

Building the Core Blog Features {#core-features}

We'll now replace the starter content with our blog structure. First, let's clean up and create the necessary folders.

1. Clean Up: Delete the app/page.js file. We will create our own.
2. Create the Blog Folder Structure: In the app directory, create a nested folder structure for our dynamic blog posts: blog/[slug]. This [slug] folder is a dynamic segment, meaning Next.js will create a page for every possible slug value.
   ```bash
   mkdir -p app/blog/[slug]
   ```

Fetching & Displaying Blog Posts {#fetching-posts}

Let's build the blog homepage that fetches and lists all posts.

1. Create the Blog Index Page (app/blog/page.js):
