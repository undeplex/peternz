## Introduction to Next.js 14

Next.js, the React-based framework by Vercel, continues to innovate with the release of version 14. It empowers developers to create fast, scalable, and feature-rich applications while simplifying complex workflows.

## What's New in Next.js 14?

### Improved App Router

Next.js 14 enhances the App Router, enabling seamless server and client components with improved hydration and streaming capabilities. These improvements significantly reduce Time to Interactive (TTI).

### Enhanced Performance

Performance optimization remains a priority, with features like automatic prefetching and optimized bundle splitting. The integration of Turbopack as the default bundler further boosts build speed.

### AI-Powered Features

Next.js 14 introduces AI-based tools like AI Routing Assistance, allowing applications to adapt routing dynamically based on user behavior.

## Setting Up a Next.js 14 Project

Follow these steps to create a new Next.js 14 project:

1. Install Node.js
Ensure you have Node.js 18 or higher installed.


2. Initialize a New Project

npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```bash
cd my-next-app
```

3. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Your development server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Code Example: Building a Dynamic Web Page

Here's a simple example of building a dynamic blog page using the new App Router:

```jsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.js
import { use } from 'react';

async function fetchPost(slug) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Post not found');
  return res.json();
}

export default function BlogPost({ params }) {
  const post = use(fetchPost(params.slug));

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```
Key Highlights:

Dynamic Routing: [slug] allows dynamic URL handling.

Async Data Fetching: use(fetchPost) simplifies fetching and rendering.

## SEO Best Practices in Next.js 14

1. Optimize Metadata
Use the new <Metadata> component in the App Router to set SEO metadata:

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next.js 14 Blog',
  description: 'Learn all about Next.js 14 with code examples and resources.',
};


2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Leverage SSR for better search engine indexing:

```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return { props: { data } };
}
```

3. Image Optimization
Utilize the <Image> component for responsive and lazy-loaded images.


4. Sitemap Generation
Automate sitemap generation using tools like next-sitemap.
