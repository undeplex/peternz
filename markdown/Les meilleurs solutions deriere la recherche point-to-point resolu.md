Welcome to the JavaScript Fundamentals Course! This course is designed to teach you JavaScript from the basics to advanced topics with practical code examples.

We’ll cover variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and much more!


## Introduction

JavaScript is the most popular language for web development. It allows you to build interactive and dynamic websites. Here’s the first piece of code to get started:


```js
// This is a simple JavaScript program
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
let greeting = "Hello World"; // String
let score = 100; // Number
let isCompleted = true; // Boolean

let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]; // Array
let person = { name: "John", age: 30 }; // Object

console.log(typeof greeting); // Output: string
console.log(fruits[1]); // Output: Banana
console.log(person.name); // Output: John
```
